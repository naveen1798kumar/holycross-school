            `We are, indubitably, aware that the rural students as against their urban counterparts do not enjoy the same educational facilities to meet the challenge. We need to go extra mile to coach the rural students; because their English knowledge is far from being satisfactory. Besides, there are intellectuals in the rural areas but with little opportunities for developments. Our mission is to discern them and shape them to equate with the urban peers.

In accordance with our motto- To love and To serve - we do not deny admission for the reason of grovelling poverty. We focus on healthy brain and not on wealthy purse. No student should get suppressed and depressed and distressed due to slim or empty purse.

With the explicit and formal approval of the ecclesiastical authorities of FATHERS OF HOLYCROSS, TRICHY, the work commenced with big bang; we had a tough time to secure building License and other relevant certificates; and finally, to the great joy of all, we got the Recognition and Non-objection Certificates from the State Government of Tamil Nadu.

The School is quite easily traceable and accessible. It is in full public view on the Highways. `

      content1 : `The seed sprouts into a seedling, then the seedling grows into a plant and the plant in turn grows into a huge tree. HOLY CROSS SCHOOL is nothing but vision, and this vision metamorphosed into this thriving institution.

I am immensely happy to state HOLY CROSS SCHOOL is to impart quality value-based education to young minds and besides imparting knowledge is on road to take the Learners-the students beyond the classroom learning to connect them to the real-life learning, according them an excellent, conducive and congenial learning atmosphere. In view of this noble ideal, I am inviting the stakeholders, parents and well-wishers to experience the educational revolution that is unfolding magnificently in a well-equipped, furnished, modernized stress-free school campus.

Let the teachers and the parents dedicate wholly themselves to walk that-extra-mile to be a supporting, enervating and motivating factor towards making the child's dreams come true. This is the greatest thing that someone can do to a growing child!

I am sure that students are not only imparted knowledge but also inculcated values and ethics to uphold the true purpose of education and to become the responsible citizens and assets to the nation. The best citizens are made in the classrooms. I am certain the Principal along with his industrious team- teaching and non-teaching fraternity will steer the School to dizzying heights to achieve many laurels and fulfill the dreams of our organisation.

Wishing you all Good luck for the future!`

Sheer Marks can never determine one's intelligence and potentials. In every student there can be a singer, an artist, a poet, a reporter, an engineer, a doctor, afashion designer, a teacher,a writer, etc. There is a whopping number of opportunities, awaiting them in the world, to which their unique character and skill should fit best.

Our Institution’s aim is to cater to the educational needs of children belonging to different strata of our society in the district and beyond. Our school aims to provide each child with a holistic learning experience based upon our traditional values amidst the rapid pace of technological change.

"Time is not measured by the passing of years but by what one does, what one feels, and what one achieves" said Jawaharlal Nehru."Education which does not mould character is wholly worthless”, said Mahatma Gandhi. With these ideals as the base and the vision, I am sure the school will, under no circumstance, compromise on values and ethics to mould our children into becoming model citizens of India.

I am also confident that the Principal and our team of dedicated teachers in the classrooms and the sports fields will impart the essential knowledge and skills to every child so that they may live up to our school’s motto, “TO LOVE & TO SERVE”`

"Education is the most powerful weapon which one can use to change the world:" Nelson Mandela. Our focus is on the holistic development of the pupil and our vision is to create a teaching-learning ambience to reap excellence. Every facet of the pupil's interest is taken care of, and excellent training is given to hone the skills of the students.

Our school Website serves as the key bond between the school and the parents. On the one hand it keeps the parents informed of the activities, events and programmes of the school and on the other hand it disseminates information on laurels earned and academic excellence.

      content1 : `In the modern world and electronic age, while challenges haunt the Teachers & the Parents of 21st Century, it is Education that opens the window to the world; turns an ordinary man into an extraordinary one with its spell; bridges the gaps and establishes equality between the high and the low in the society; and it's the world's noblest philosophy. Education paves way for attaining our goals and shaping up our lives. Education is not meant to seek fame, but to earn an honour and dignity through what one has learnt. The one who has an ambition attains his goal and the vice versa.

The 21st Century poses lots of challenges for imparting quality education, so our Instructional Pedagogies need to be designed, revamped and oriented in such a way as to overcome the challenges of the present century. The School Syllabus should not merely focus on the glorification of the ancient history-the then terrible bloody wars and the victories won on the blood-path, on the other hand it should gear up the child to fulfill his/her present as well as future needs. The school system should focus on holistic development of the child placing the child at the "centre" of the teaching learning process. As the world has become a global village, we should all prepare ourselves to be techno-savvy before students, who are astoundingly and inspiringly tall. In the modern world, teachers are expected to be updated with the latest technological revolutions and evolutions, should have enormous interest to learn what is not known to her/him. In ancient times, students considered their teachers as their gurus and were dependent on them, borrowing their ideas and opinions taking every word of them as their life's philosophy, whereas the present generation is not dependent on their gurus, as today they can access, collect and collate information from internet. So if we don't "update" ourselves with the latest information or developments we will be "outdated"-lagging far behind!`,

      content2 : `If only education is imparted as per the demands of the present gen, will teaching-learning process become interesting; otherwise it's going to be a waste of time and energy, amounting to no good. If only the students, the teachers and the parents, realizing their collective responsibilities, work together, they will be able to meet the demands posed by the 21st century. There are innumerable talents dormant and untapped in every student; it is the responsibility of the teacher to discover and develop them, nurturing their inclinations. Parents may discuss and put forward the abounding opportunities, but we should take great care that no one foists one’s own aspirations on the children. Instead we should encourage our children to attain their goal. Only then can our country see intellectuals and scholars in every field.

Education is not merely book-oriented;It should prepare the child beyond the textbook and connect it with the real life scenario and their life independently. Marks can never determine one's intelligence and potential. In every student may be a singer, an artist, a poet, a reporter, a news reader, a fashion designer, a teacher, a writer etc. This should be identified and developed so that they may become great as per their inclinations and ambitions. The phenomena that medicine and engineering are the topmost professions one can think of should be purged out, lock,stock and barrel from the minds of the people. There are endless opportunities awaiting them in the world-just waiting for them to discover! Dr. Abdul Kalam's words: every person in this world has a page in the history, but it is the individual who has to make others to see and read it! Let the teachers and the parents dedicate wholly themselves to walk that-extra-mile to be a supporting, energising and motivating factor towards making the child's dreams come true. This is the greatest thing that someone can do to a growing child!`,
